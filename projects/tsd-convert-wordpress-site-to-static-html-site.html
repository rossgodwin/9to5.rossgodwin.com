				<p>
					This was a fun, rewarding and necessary project where I improved a small office network to be a better 
					performing, more stable network resulting in improved office productivity and scalability for future company 
					growth. If you are just interested in pictures, <a href="#pictures">here are before and after photos</a>.

					Shortly after starting employment with <a href="{% link cv/tsd.html %}">{{ site.data.cv.jobs[site.data.cv.job_index_tsd].company.name }}</a> 
					I began poking around at the network and computer components. After investigation the IT infrastructure and using 
					it on a daily basis it was evident that an upgrade was needed due to slow computer and network performance.
					
					it was evident that updates to workstations and network topology as well as cybersecurity
					measures were needed.
					There were also some security vulnerabilities that needed addressing.
