As office IT administrator

Recently I ran into an issue where our office router (Cisco Meraki) performed a firmware update late afternoon causing our office to lose connectivity to the internet.

One affect was the subnet changing from 192.168.1.x to 192.168.127.x.

For our file server we use a qnap 2 bay.  From initial setup to routine maintenance, I always been able to perform with a keyboard and monitor just using a web browser.

For a few devices on the network that weren't set to DHCP (like the qnap server). The ip address and default gateway were incorrect. Where this caused a problem for the qnap server was I couldn't connect to it remotely because it's network settings were out of wack and how could I change them if I couldn't connect.  Remember I don't use a keyboard and monitor directly on this machine.  Thank goodness qnap has published a utility called Qfinder Pro (https://www.qnap.com/en-us/utilities/essentials) which was able to identify the qnap server on the network.  This utility provides some configuration functions that allowed me to adjust it's network settings.

 

Right-click the qnap device that shows up in the list and choose 'General Settings' - it will prompt you for your login information

Select the 'Network Settings' tab

My was set to 'Use static IP address'

I selected the option 'Obtain IP address settings automatically via DHCP'
