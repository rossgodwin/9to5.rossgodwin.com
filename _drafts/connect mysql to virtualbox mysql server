VirtualBox Manager -> Settings -> Network -> Attached to: NAT -> Advanced -> Port Forwarding - add the following rule:
	Name: MySQL
	Protocol: TCP
	Host IP: leave blank
	Host Port: 3306
	Guest IP: leave blank
	Guest Port: 3306

My install is a MariaDB (Since MariaDB is a fork of MySQL) so I had to update the config file to allow ip address other than localhost
$ sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
Comment out the line
	bind-address = 127.0.0.1
Add the following line
	bind-address = 0.0.0.0

Because I'm running this in a local development I'm opening this up to any address (hence 0.0.0.0).  In a deployment environment it would be better to specify the ip address of the application server connecting to the database.

Restart
$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart

Lastly, give the user permission from a remote host to the database.  Here because it is a local development environment I'm going to grant the user all permissions from any host.
$ sudo mysql -u root -p
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name_here.* TO 'username_here'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password_here';
mysql> flush privileges;
mysql> select user, host from mysql.user;


Helpful log locations:
For MySQL workbench: C:\Users\dev\AppData\Roaming\MySQL\Workbench\log
For MySQL server: sudo nano /var/log/mysql/error.log
