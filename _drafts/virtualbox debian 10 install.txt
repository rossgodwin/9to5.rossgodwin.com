

1) Download a Debian Linux ISO

https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/

https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch04s02.en.html
https://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist
https://www.debian.org/CD/
Download CD/DVD images using HTTP - https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/
Official CD/DVD images of the stable release - https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/#stable
I'm installing on a PC so I chose amd64 - https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/

You can download the netinst image, which is the smaller image.  During the installation process it will install the core system but it will have a step where you can choose the desktop environment that you would like to install.

There is an Xfce iso.  Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment.

2) Create a new virtualbox and install Debian Linux

The following instructional blog was very helpful in creating a new Debian linux virtual machine:

https://www.brianlinkletter.com/installing-debian-linux-in-a-virtualbox-virtual-machine/


Linux /dev/sda is the first hard (the primary master) and /dev/sdb is the second.  The numbers refer to partitions, so /dev/sda1 is the first partition of the first drive.


3) Troubleshoot

You may start the virtual machine and receive a error.
"Failed to open a session for the virtual machine."
"Not in a hypervisor partition (HVP=0) (VERR_NEM_NOT_AVAILABLE).
AMD-V is disabled in thee BIOS (or by the host OS) (VERR_SVM_DISABLED)"

AMD-V is the renamed trademark for Secure Virtual Machine Mode (SVM). The number one reason why the  AMD-V is disabled in the BIOS (or by the host OS) (VERR_SVM_DISABLED) error occurs is because the AMD-V technology is disabled from your BIOS Settings.

To fix you have to enable SVM Mode (Secure Virtual Machine Mode).

In order to do this for in my MSI BIOS.  Go to Overclocking -> CPU Features -> SVM Mode - toggle to Enabled


4) Enable copy/paste between guest and host machines

There are 2 steps to take:

1 - In VirtualBox Manager go to Settings -> General -> Advanced - change 'Shared Clipboard' and 'Drag'n'Drop' to 'Bidirectional'

2 - Install guest services to enable copy/past between host and guest machine

Download VBoxGuestAdditions_x.x.xx.iso for the version of VirtualBox you have.
https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox
So for 6.1.10 go to
https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.10/

Follow this tutorial

In the step when you go to the drive with the guest services iso mounted.  I could not get the 'Run Software' command to work.  It would give me the error 'Unable to locate the program'.  So instead I opened a terminal window and installed it manually.
$ cd /media/cdrom0
$ sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

5) Configure the virtualbox so apache is accessible from the host machine

Settings -> Network -> Adapter 1
	* for 'Attached to' select 'NAT'
	* Advanced -> Port Forwarding - add a new port forwarding rule
		* Name = Apache
		* Protocol = TCP
		* Host IP = <leave blank>
		* Host Port = 80
		* Guest IP = <leave blank>
		* Guest Port = 80

From your host maching you can access the apache web server using the loop back address (http://127.0.0.1) or the host machines ip address.
