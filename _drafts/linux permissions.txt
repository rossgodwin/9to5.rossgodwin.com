--- Understanding file permissions ---

-rw-r--r--
	* 1st dash indicates type of file
		* d for directory
		* s for special file
		* - for a regular file
	* The next three characters (rw-) define the ownerâ€™s permission to the file
	* The next three characters (r--) are the permissions for the members of the same group as the file owner
	* The last three characters (r--) show the permissions for all other users


--- sudo ---

* Root is the super user and has the ability to do anything on a system
* A sudo user should be used in place of root 
* sudo is a tool that gives users and groups access to commands and resources they normally would not be able to use
* sudo enables a user to have administration privileges without logging in directly as root
* To provide a user with sudo ability they need to 1) be added to a sudo enabled group or 2) their username be added to sudoers file

$ su root
$ sudo visudo

When you save your changes it will save to the lock file /etc/sudoers.tmp and then basically copies it to the real /etc/sudoers file.

List the current logged in user
$ whoami
List groups
$ cat /etc/group
List the groups the current user belongs to
$ groups {USER-NAME-HERE}
or
$ id {USER-NAME-HERE}
List members of a group
$ getent group www-data
or
$ grep ^www-data /etc/group

Add user to www-data group
sudo adduser {USER-NAME-HERE} www-data

Log out and log back in - close the linux terminal window and reopen
