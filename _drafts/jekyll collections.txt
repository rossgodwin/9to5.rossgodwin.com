-----
Keep all your collections in 1 folder to keep your root folder from getting to large.

Use collections_dir in _config.yml
i.e. collections_dir: my_collections

-----
Use categories with collections

Let's say you want to have a collection for your "tech" writings and then you want to categorize some of those writings as "notes".

In _config.yml

collections:
  tech:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title:output_ext

In your folder structure
-> _tech
	-> notes
		-> _posts

You don't have to create the notes folder but it might be nice to use to keep things a little more organized.

For the blog post, in between the triple-dashed lines set the Front Matter variable "categories"
