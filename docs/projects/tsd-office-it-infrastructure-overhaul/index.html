				<h4 class="heading heading-leading-vertical-bar">About the Project</h4>
				<p>
					This was a fun, rewarding and necessary project where I improved a small office network to be a better 
					performing, more stable network resulting in improved office productivity and scalability for future company 
					growth. If you are just interested in pictures, <a href="#pictures">here are before and after photos</a>.

				<h4 class="heading heading-leading-vertical-bar">Background</h4>
				<p>
					Shortly after starting employment with <a href="/cv/tsd/">Triangle Site Design</a> 
					I began poking around at the network and computer components. After investigation the IT infrastructure and using 
					it on a daily basis it was evident that an upgrade was needed due to slow computer and network performance.
					
					it was evident that updates to workstations and network topology as well as cybersecurity
					measures were needed.
					There were also some security vulnerabilities that needed addressing.
				</p>
				<p>
					I brought the issues that I found to the company owner's attention and initiated the idea of making some changes. 
					He indicated to me that over the course of a few years in that current office location they had spent thousands 
					of dollars with two different vendors and had trouble getting the infrastructure to where it currently was 
					which was a functioning network but lacked in performance and expandability.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here were some of the current conditions that I found:

				<h4 class="heading heading-leading-vertical-bar">Met Goals</h4>
				<p>
					After analyzing existing network limitations, research better network and hardware options, plan for future 
					expandibility and consider cost.  Here were some goals that I had in mind researching 
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						<b>Goal:</b> find a ISP that could provide reasonably priced dedicated internet access.
					</i>
					<p>
						<a href="https://celito.net" target="_blank">Celito</a> is a local internet service provider that was 
						looking to venture in to the office complex where we were located. We made the switch and have been 
						extremely pleased with the dedicated fiber service that we receive and their wonderful customer support.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						<b>Goal:</b> transform the small closet that was a tangled mess of cables and equipment laying around 
						on the floor in to a space that resembles a organized server room.
					</i>
					<p>
						To get things off the floor and make working on the network easier, I decided to go with a wall mounted rack. 
						I chose the <a href="https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/Racks/6U-14in-Deep-Wall-Mounting-Bracket-for-Patch-Panel~WALLMOUNT6" target="_blank">StarTech.com 6U wall mount network equipment rack</a>.
						This meant that any network components that I purchased from here out would need to be compatible 
						with a 19 inch rack.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						<b>Goal:</b> replace existing router.
					</i>
					<p>
						The router in use was a Cisco Meraki and based on my research in the specifications was not a good fit for 
						our environment.
						
						I upgraded to the <a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-routing/usg" target="_blank">UniFi Security Gateway</a> 
						by Ubiquiti Networks.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						<b>Goal:</b> consolidate the two network switches in to one. There was an 8-port non-PoE switch sitting between the workstations and router 
						and off of that was a 16-port PoE switch that was used to provide power and connectivity for the wireless 
						access points.
					</i>
					<p>
						I went with a <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/110-series-unmanaged-switches/index.html" target="_blank">Cisco 
						SG110 24-Port unmanaged PoE network switch</a>, which provides 12 PoE ports. Enough for the 2 wireless 
						access points that are powered over the ethernet. And 12 non-PoE ports.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Goal:</b> hardwire each office with ethernet cable so that workstations no longer depend on wireless 
					connectivity.</i>
					<p>
						To future proof the cable installation, I decided to go with Cat6a ethernet. I chose a product by 
						<a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=301&cp_id=30103&cs_id=3010303&p_id=18593&seq=1&format=2" target="_blank">Monoprice</a> 
						that was rated F/UTP which wraps the 23AWG wire in a foil shield that acts as a barrier preventing interference and 
						data signal leaks.
					</p>
					<p>
						To organize the cable feeds coming in to the server closet from the offices, I went with 
						a <a href="https://www.cablematters.com/pc-445-162-rackmount-or-wallmount-24-port-cat6a-shielded-rj45-patch-panel-with-jack-shutter.aspx" target="_blank">24-port 
						Cable Matters rackmount Cat6a patch panel</a>. Outlets in the office would be provided by 
						<a href="https://cat5ecableguy.com/inc/sdetail/238566" target="_blank">surface mount box</a>.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						<b>Goal:</b> upgrade the network storage access because of the volume of reads and writes required of it 
						and because it's such a critical piece to the daily business operation.
					</i>
					<p>
						
						
						Part of this would be to Free up the network storage server resources by offloading backup workload to a seperate dedicated 
							workstation
					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						<b>Goal:</b> data redundancy, emergency failover option and office uptime during power flickers and outages.
					</i>
					<p>
						For data backup, I chose not put this burden on the network storage device. Rather I took that workstation 
						that served as the older file server and dedicated it to managing data backup.
					</p>
					<p>
						For uptime during power flickers and outages, I made sure each employee workstation was equipped with a 
						function UPS. For the network hardware I chose a rackmount power supply by 
						<a href="https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/ups/smart-app-lcd/or500lcdrm1u/" target="_blank">CypberPower</a>.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						<b>Goal:</b> network folder space for each employee.
					</i>
					<p>
						The main reason I wanted to set this up was for ease of employee information backup. Rather than having 
						to maintain backup processes on each individual computer, I setup a personal network folder for them to 
						use instead of the local C drive. The Linux based QTS kernel on the QNAP network access storage device 
						provides nice management of users, folder resources and access privileges.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>
						<b>Goal:</b> provide new computers for employees also individual network storage 
					</i>
					<p>
						and thus automatic backing up
					</p>
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h4 class="heading heading-leading-vertical-bar">Results</h4>
				<p>
					I was very pleased with how everything turned out as was my boss and coworkers. The improvement in speed, latency 
					and stability has been a drastic one.  A lot of our traffic is internal so with the Gigabit network, hardwired 
					workstations and new network storage,
				</p>
				<p>
					Since performing this upgrade, the company has hired one additional full time employee and 2 summer interns. We have 
					also made the switch to IP phones. Had these infrastructure changes not been made, supporting this additional load 
					would have been interesting to say the least and probably made a negative impact on office productivity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The power backup strategy worked well and has been tested a couple of times and worked great. Also the data backup 
					strategy has really worked out well and has been a hands off solution.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the employee network folders I no longer had to worry about how to backup data on each individual workstation 
					and also requiring less hard drive space on individual desktops
				</p>
				<p>
					One other thing that I'll mention is I installed the UniFi Controller service on the backup machine and has allowed 
					me to perform monitoring and maintenance on the netork. This is a very nice interface
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h4 class="heading heading-leading-vertical-bar">Things I Would Do Different</h4>
				<p>
					One thing I would do differently would be to run two ethernet cables to each office instead of just one. We also 
					made the switch to IP phones and it would have been nice an additional line dedicated for the workstation and the 
					other for the IP phone or a switch for multiple devices like an IP phone or laptop.
