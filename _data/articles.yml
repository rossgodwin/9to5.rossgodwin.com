    description: A collection of notes I have taken on subjects as I have performed research on various topics. A majority 
      of the notes are frequently taken during research pertaining to a technology that I am interested in integrating into 
      a project. An example would be, testing the compatibility and functionality of photo gallery rendering frameworks that 
      are used in websites.
